**Author:** Jason Wang

**Date:** Nov 10th, 2015

**Version:** 1.0

**Functionality:** Simple Calulator

    1. Implementation of basic arithmatic (plus/mius/mutiply/division)
	
    2. By now just can be operated between two operands
	
**Bugs:**

	1. Precision Problem
	
	2. Some kind of things I have not realized
	
**Future work:**

	1. Implement the operation of multiple operands
	
	2. Add more operator to do more complicated arithmatic
